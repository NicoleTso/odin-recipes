A sample web project, to get accustomed to links,lists,and images added through html.This is my second upload on github, so the staging and commit messages, are still a little messy.

Didn't edit, push or commit(maybe i am missing more of these git actions)during working on the projects, because 1) i am still getting used to Git mechanics, and 2) i worked on these webpages in one sitting, and my focus was mostly to get used to the html elements and tags.
