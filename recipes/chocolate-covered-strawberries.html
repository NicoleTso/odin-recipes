<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The simplest version of chocolate-covered strawberries I know. Paraffin was originally used instead of shortening. White chocolate may be drizzled over the milk chocolate for a fancier look. They are perfect for weddings when decorated with frosting bow ties, bells, butterflies, roses, etc.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>16 ounces milk chocolate chips</li>
<li>2 tablespoons shortening</li>
<li>toothpicks</li>
<li>1 pound fresh strawberries with leaves</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>

    <li>Melt chocolate and shortening in a double boiler, stirring occasionally until smooth.
    </li>
    <li>Insert toothpicks into tops (stem ends) of strawberries. Hold a strawberry by the toothpick and dip it into the chocolate mixture. </li>
    <li>Turn the strawberry upside down and insert the toothpick into a Styrofoam block or place strawberry on a sheet of waxed paper; allow chocolate coating to cool. Repeat with remaining strawberries.</li>


</ol>
